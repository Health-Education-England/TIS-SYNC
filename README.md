# TIS-SYNC

This Service takes the current cron jobs from the TCS service, running them from this service instead.

### Run jobs directly on server
If a job needs to be run manually, e.g. after a database has been re-imported to stage:

1. Copy the commands below into your favorite text editor.
2. Replace the $bean_name and $job_method with the ones for the job you are re-running.
3. ssh into green server and paste the modified commands in a single chunk and it will go through the process of:
   - downloading the JDK and the JMX client
   - copy them to the container
   - extract the compressed JDK
   - launch the JMX client and
   - restart the sync job.

N.B. Refer to the "Job Execution Order" above to see whether there is an appending Job which needs to be run afterward.

```
cd /tmp
mkdir javatools
cd javatools
wget https://heetisrequiredapps.blob.core.windows.net/javafiles/jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar
wget https://heetisrequiredapps.blob.core.windows.net/javafiles/jdk-8-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd ..
docker cp javatools sync_sync_1:/tmp
docker exec -it sync_sync_1 /bin/bash
cd /tmp/javatools
tar -zxvf jdk-8-linux-x64.tar.gz
rm jdk-8-linux-x64.tar.gz
./jdk1.8.0_202/bin/java -jar jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar
open 1
domain sync.mbean
bean sync.mbean:name=$bean_name
run $job_method
run isCurrentlyRunning
exit
```
When you're back at the **bash-4.4#** prompt you can run the following command to keep an eye on the progress of the sync.

`tail /var/log/apps/sync.log -f`

### Run jobs on Buttons Page
